"""Interactive chart layout editor (Tools → Edit / create chart layout).

Loads any RGB ``.ti2`` (or starts a new chart), lets the user reorder patches,
recolour patches and spacers, preview the rendered chart, and save a new valid
``.ti2`` + page TIFF(s). All chart logic lives in :mod:`workflow.ti2_relayout`;
this module is purely the Qt front-end driving it.

The editor mutates a *device-value program* (an ordered list of 0..100 RGB
tuples). Reordering permutes it, recolouring a patch replaces an entry — exactly
the core's model. Spacers are handled two ways: a native palette (written into
the regenerated chart so printtarg renders it, contrast-optimised and readable)
and an optional per-spacer paint applied to the rendered TIFF.

_GEN_SETS_HELP = (
    "About “Generate colour sets”:\n\n"
    "Tick any combination of these five sets and ChromIQ lays them down "
    "one after another. Each set shows how many patches it adds, and a "
    "running total appears underneath, so you always know how big the "
    "chart will get before you create it:\n\n"
    "• 3D RGB cube — an even grid of colours across the whole range. You "
    "pick how many steps each of red, green and blue is split into, and "
    "the chart then holds every combination (for example 6 steps makes "
    "6×6×6 = 216 patches). A solid, neutral foundation for almost any "
    "profile.\n\n"
    "• Skin tones (Fitzpatrick) — lifelike skin colours running light to "
    "dark through each of the six Fitzpatrick skin types, now reaching "
    "from porcelain-pale highlights down to very deep, faintly cool "
    "shadows. 'Per type' sets how many shades each type gets from light "
    "to dark; 'Ranges' adds that many parallel ramps, each nudged a "
    "little in hue, so a single skin type is covered by a small spread of "
    "tones rather than one straight line — handy because real faces vary. "
    "Worth adding whenever faces and portraits matter most.\n\n"
    "• Oceans (blues) — extra colours packed into the green-turquoise "
    "to deep-blue part of the range, where wide-gamut papers and inks "
    "reach furthest (it now dips into the greenish turquoise too). "
    "'Per layer' is how many patches each sheet holds and 'Layers' is how "
    "many sheets, so the two multiply (24 per layer × 3 layers = 72). The "
    "sheets are gently angled rather than one flat blanket, so the whole "
    "turquoise corner is filled in depth. Helpful for skies, water and "
    "deep blues.\n\n"
    "• Foliage (greens) — a spread of forest, jungle and leaf greens, for "
    "landscapes and nature shots where the greens carry the picture. As "
    "with the blues, 'Per layer' × 'Layers' patches are spread across "
    "angled sheets so the green part of the range is covered with more "
    "depth.\n\n"
    "• Neutral grey ramp — a plain ramp of pure greys from black to white, "
    "with no tints at all (a black-and-white wedge). This is the most "
    "important region for a clean profile. 'Steps' is how many greys span "
    "black to white. It is independent of Near-neutral greys below, so you "
    "can choose the number of pure neutrals separately from the tinted "
    "ones — more pure greys than tinted, or either on its own.\n\n"
    "• Near-neutral greys — rings of gentle tints just off the neutral axis "
    "at each grey level, which is what helps greys print cleanly without an "
    "unwanted colour cast. This adds only the tints; the pure grey centres "
    "come from Neutral grey ramp above. 'Steps' is how many levels get "
    "rings, 'rings' is how many rings circle each grey (one ring is six "
    "tints, each extra ring a wider, denser one — 12, then 18), and "
    "'offset' is how far the tints stray from neutral.\n\n"
    "• Saturated edges — the most vivid colours the printer can manage. "
    "'Per edge' traces the twelve edges of the colour cube — the gamut "
    "wireframe (black up to each pure colour and on to white, plus the "
    "colourful edges between); 'per face' goes further and also fills the "
    "six cube faces — the full gamut surface — with that many patches per "
    "side, or leave it at 0 for edges only. This outer boundary is exactly "
    "where profiles tend to go wrong, so it pays to sample it well.\n\n"
    "• Highlights & shadows — extra detail at the two ends where printers "
    "struggle most: pale tints just below paper white, and deep tones just "
    "above black, spread across every hue. These ends often band or block "
    "up, and the cube alone samples them thinly. 'Per end' is how many "
    "patches go at each end (so the set adds twice that many), and 'depth' "
    "is how far in from white and black the tones reach.\n\n"
    "• Pastels — soft, muted colours all around the hue wheel: dusty blues, "
    "sages, soft pinks, taupes. This is where a great deal of real "
    "photography actually lives — the gentle region between the clean greys "
    "and the vivid sets. Each of the 'layers' is a chroma shell — from "
    "barely-tinted near-greys out to fuller pastels — of 'per layer' "
    "patches, so the two multiply.\n\n"
    "• From image — load one of your own photos and ChromIQ finds its most "
    "representative colours and adds them to the chart, so the profile is "
    "tuned to the kind of pictures you really print. Click 'Load image…', "
    "pick a file, and set how many 'Colours' to pull out. Lovely combined "
    "with a cube for all-round coverage plus your image's own palette on "
    "top.\n\n"
    "• Fill remaining gaps — a tidy-up that comes last. After the sets you "
    "picked are laid down, it scatters extra patches into the empty parts "
    "of colour space — evenly and without repeating — until the chart "
    "reaches the size you ask for. 'Fill to' is that target total, so the "
    "whole chart lands on a round number with nothing left clumped or "
    "bare.\n\n"
    "Mix them freely — say a 3D cube for overall coverage plus "
    "a neutral grey ramp for clean neutrals, or skin tones plus greens for "
    "portraits out in nature.\n\n"
    "• Ensure unique colours — when this is ticked and your sets happen to "
    "share a colour (for example a 3D cube and a grey ramp both include "
    "black and white), ChromIQ keeps one and nudges the duplicates apart "
    "by a tiny amount, so no colour is printed and measured twice. The "
    "patch total stays the same. Leave it on unless you have a reason not "
    "to."

    """QListWidget with drag-reorder UX tweaks.

    Drop handling is Qt's default (Snap + InternalMove) — that combo is what
    QListView's reorder logic actually targets, and the previous custom
    dropEvent fought with it (items snapping back was the symptom).

    Two visual tweaks on top of Qt's behaviour:

    1. While a drag is active, the source items get a washed-out / dashed
       icon so the source slot stays visible alongside the drag pixmap.
    2. The drop indicator is painted by us at the **gap midpoint** between
       the two items around the cursor — Qt's built-in indicator otherwise
       snaps to either side of the gap depending on cursor position, which
       reads as visual flicker even though the resulting reorder is the
       same. We hide the built-in one and draw a single mid-gap line.

            "you can arrange and fine-tune everything.\n\n"
            "What each choice means:\n\n"
            "• Instrument & Paper — which measuring device you'll use and what "
            "paper you'll print on. ChromIQ uses these to lay the patches out in a "
            "way your device can read, at the right page size.\n\n"
            "• Patches — how to fill the chart to begin with. There are three ways:\n"
            "    – Seed from targen — enter a number and let ChromIQ spread that "
            "many colours evenly across the whole colour range. A great all-round "
            "starting point you can then rearrange.\n"
            "    – Paste colour values — paste, or load from a file, your own list "
            "of hex or RGB colours.\n"
            "    – Generate colour sets — build the chart from one or more "
            "ready-made colour spreads (described below).\n\n"
            "• Layout options — the finer print settings (spacer squares, sizing, "
            "page margin, resolution). The defaults are sensible, so feel free to "
            "leave these alone until you need them.\n\n"
            "About “Generate colour sets”:\n\n"
            "Tick any combination of these five sets and ChromIQ lays them down "
            "one after another. Each set shows how many patches it adds, and a "
            "running total appears underneath, so you always know how big the "
            "chart will get before you create it:\n\n"
            "• 3D RGB cube — an even grid of colours across the whole range. You "
            "pick how many steps each of red, green and blue is split into, and "
            "the chart then holds every combination (for example 6 steps makes "
            "6×6×6 = 216 patches). A solid, neutral foundation for almost any "
            "profile.\n\n"
            "• Skin tones (Fitzpatrick) — lifelike skin colours running light to "
            "dark through each of the six Fitzpatrick skin types, now reaching "
            "from porcelain-pale highlights down to very deep, faintly cool "
            "shadows. 'Per type' sets how many shades each type gets from light "
            "to dark; 'Ranges' adds that many parallel ramps, each nudged a "
            "little in hue, so a single skin type is covered by a small spread of "
            "tones rather than one straight line — handy because real faces vary. "
            "Worth adding whenever faces and portraits matter most.\n\n"
            "• Oceans (blues) — extra colours packed into the green-turquoise "
            "to deep-blue part of the range, where wide-gamut papers and inks "
            "reach furthest (it now dips into the greenish turquoise too). "
            "'Per layer' is how many patches each sheet holds and 'Layers' is how "
            "many sheets, so the two multiply (24 per layer × 3 layers = 72). The "
            "sheets are gently angled rather than one flat blanket, so the whole "
            "turquoise corner is filled in depth. Helpful for skies, water and "
            "deep blues.\n\n"
            "• Foliage (greens) — a spread of forest, jungle and leaf greens, for "
            "landscapes and nature shots where the greens carry the picture. As "
            "with the blues, 'Per layer' × 'Layers' patches are spread across "
            "angled sheets so the green part of the range is covered with more "
            "depth.\n\n"
            "• Neutral grey ramp — a plain ramp of pure greys from black to white, "
            "with no tints at all (a black-and-white wedge). This is the most "
            "important region for a clean profile. 'Steps' is how many greys span "
            "black to white. It is independent of Near-neutral greys below, so you "
            "can choose the number of pure neutrals separately from the tinted "
            "ones — more pure greys than tinted, or either on its own.\n\n"
            "• Near-neutral greys — rings of gentle tints just off the neutral axis "
            "at each grey level, which is what helps greys print cleanly without an "
            "unwanted colour cast. This adds only the tints; the pure grey centres "
            "come from Neutral grey ramp above. 'Steps' is how many levels get "
            "rings, 'rings' is how many rings circle each grey (one ring is six "
            "tints, each extra ring a wider, denser one — 12, then 18), and "
            "'offset' is how far the tints stray from neutral.\n\n"
            "• Saturated edges — the most vivid colours the printer can manage. "
            "'Per edge' traces the twelve edges of the colour cube — the gamut "
            "wireframe (black up to each pure colour and on to white, plus the "
            "colourful edges between); 'per face' goes further and also fills the "
            "six cube faces — the full gamut surface — with that many patches per "
            "side, or leave it at 0 for edges only. This outer boundary is exactly "
            "where profiles tend to go wrong, so it pays to sample it well.\n\n"
            "• Highlights & shadows — extra detail at the two ends where printers "
            "struggle most: pale tints just below paper white, and deep tones just "
            "above black, spread across every hue. These ends often band or block "
            "up, and the cube alone samples them thinly. 'Per end' is how many "
            "patches go at each end (so the set adds twice that many), and 'depth' "
            "is how far in from white and black the tones reach.\n\n"
            "• Pastels — soft, muted colours all around the hue wheel: dusty blues, "
            "sages, soft pinks, taupes. This is where a great deal of real "
            "photography actually lives — the gentle region between the clean greys "
            "and the vivid sets. Each of the 'layers' is a chroma shell — from "
            "barely-tinted near-greys out to fuller pastels — of 'per layer' "
            "patches, so the two multiply.\n\n"
            "• From image — load one of your own photos and ChromIQ finds its most "
            "representative colours and adds them to the chart, so the profile is "
            "tuned to the kind of pictures you really print. Click 'Load image…', "
            "pick a file, and set how many 'Colours' to pull out. Lovely combined "
            "with a cube for all-round coverage plus your image's own palette on "
            "top.\n\n"
            "• Fill remaining gaps — a tidy-up that comes last. After the sets you "
            "picked are laid down, it scatters extra patches into the empty parts "
            "of colour space — evenly and without repeating — until the chart "
            "reaches the size you ask for. 'Fill to' is that target total, so the "
            "whole chart lands on a round number with nothing left clumped or "
